Naveen Kumar Rajarajan is currently pursuing a Master degree in Electrical at Florida State University, USA. From my sophomore year, I kindled my thoughts and ideas in making embedded-related projects. I have a keen interest in working in the field of Embedded, Robotics, the Internet Of Things, machine learning using Python, and related domains. I have 4 years of professional experience at Tata Consulting Service R&D pioneered working in embedded projects, the articulated and supported team in successful implementation and handover of Projects in the same domain, with an aim to learn and equip myself in this field and envisioning a more tech-sustainability world is my goals, and looking forward to contributing in that path.
