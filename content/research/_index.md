**Project Description**: Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new terminology of smart systems referring to the tight conjoining of and coordination between computation, comunication and physical processes.In increasingly serious adversary environment, the quest to synthesize control laws that meet the necessary resiliency requirements will become even more challenging. This research is focusing on vulnerability analysis, anomaly detection, characterization, and localization, to resilient control and state estimation designs against adversarial targeting ......

Autonomous cars are the future smart cars anticipated to be driver less, efficient and crash avoiding ideal urban car of the future. The expected autonomous driving system is a safe, accurate, reliable, resilient control system. We are constucting the first self-driving vehicle platform in Florida state university. In this project, several researches are conducted, vison-based lane detection, learning-based object detection, image-based real-world localization, robust motion control and estimation. The self-driving platform is built on a 1/10 vehicle (MicroNole) and a full-size van (AutoNole)...... [More](https://raslab.netlify.app/projects/autocontrol/)

A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers (or other computing devices) on a network. These devices split up the work, coordinating their efforts to complete the job more efficiently than if a single device had been responsible for the task. The important properties studied in distributed systems include Scalability, Concurrency, Availability/fault tolerance, Transparency, Heterogeneity, Replication ......[More](https://raslab.netlify.app/projects/distri_power/)
