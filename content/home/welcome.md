The **RAS Lab** is rooted in dynamics, control and optimization, targetting both on theoritical researches and real-life chanllenges. It provides education and research opportunities in multiple areas: <br>
- Resilient Control Systems (i.e. cyber-physical system security)<br>
- Autonomous Systems (i.e. self-driving vehicle) <br>
- Distributed Systems (i.e. energy management system)<br>
- Optimization and Deep Learning (i.e. collaborative learning)
