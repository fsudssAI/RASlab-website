<b>Project Description</b>: The cyber-threat landscape on cyber-physical critical infrastructures is widening with increasing sophistication associated with the use of IoT despite significant benefits in terms of reliability and efficiency.  The reason for this can be attributed to the advancements in information and communication technologies on the one hand and the inadequate level of security measures on legacy systems on the other hand.  As a result, the vulnerability of these systems to extreme events (cyber-attacks and natural disasters) have increased dramatically in the past few years. Developing control systems to fulfil performance objective while minimizing vulnerabilities is a challenging problem. To address the challenge, existing efforts have (a) harden a subset of the subsystems from targeted extreme events, (b) add redundant components to complement the operation of failed components, and (c) creating a supervisory component to detect, localize and neutralize the effects of the extreme events. However, the high computational and deployment cost, as well as significant risk involved with these approaches, have hampered their feasibility for use in practice. Thus, more feasible, adaptive, and real-time implementable resiliency strategies are needed...... <a href="https://raslab.netlify.app/projects/resilientcps/">More</a>

<b>Project Description</b>:Autonomous cars are the future smart cars anticipated to be driver less, efficient and crash avoiding ideal urban car of the future. The expected autonomous driving system is a safe, accurate, reliable, resilient control system. We are constucting the first self-driving vehicle platform in Florida state university. In this project, several researches are conducted, vison-based lane detection, learning-based object detection, image-based real-world localization, robust motion control and estimation. The self-driving platform is built on a 1/10 vehicle (MicroNole) and a full-size van (AutoNole)...... <a href="https://raslab.netlify.app/projects/autocontrol/">More</a>

<b>Project Description</b>:A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers (or other computing devices) on a network. These devices split up the work, coordinating their efforts to complete the job more efficiently than if a single device had been responsible for the task. The important properties studied in distributed systems include Scalability, Concurrency, Availability/fault tolerance, Transparency, Heterogeneity, Replication ...... <a href="https://raslab.netlify.app/projects/distri_power/">More</a>
