abstract: In recent years, DC and AC microgrid (MG) systems have attracted a major attention due to various potential for integration of future technology into conventional systems and control. The integration of such technology requires appropriate tools for complex design, analysis and optimization. This paper presents a mathematical low-bandwidth modeling (LBM) approach that can be used for control development in DC and further be extended to AC MG systems. In this work, first a simplified mathematical model of a medium voltage DC (MVDC) shipboard MG system is presented, next, the overall system-level connection convention is presented to display the overall mathematical coupling of the individual subsystems, then, a simplified example of the control development is presented, and last, the overall system under a test scenario is implemented in Simulink Real-time.
