abstract: Integration of modern defence weapons into ship
power systems poses a challenge in terms of meeting the high
ramp rate requirements of those loads. It might be demanding
for the generators to meet the ramp rates of these loads. Failure
to meet so, might lead to stability issues. This is addressed
by conglomeration of generators and energy storage elements
to handle the required power demand posed by loads. This
paper proposes an energy management strategy based on model
predictive control that incorporates the uncertainty in the
load prediction. The proposed controller optimally coordinates
the power split between the generators and energy storage
elements to guarantee that the power demand is met taking
into considerations the ramp rate limitations and the load
uncertainty. A low bandwidth model consisting of a single
generator and a single energy storage element is used to validate
the results of the proposed energy management strategy. The
results demonstrate the robustness of the controller under
load prediction uncertainty and demonstrate the effect of load
uncertainty on battery capacity loss.
