abstract: We consider the problem of signal reconstruction for a system under sparse signal corruption by a malicious agent. The reconstruction problem follows the standard error coding problem that has been studied extensively in the literature. We include a new challenge of robust estimation of the attack support. The problem is then cast as a constrained optimization problem merging promising techniques in the area of deep learning and estimation theory. A pruning algorithm is developed to reduce the false positive uncertainty of data-driven attack localization results, thereby improving the probability of correct signal reconstruction. Sufficient conditions for the correct reconstruction and the associated reconstruction error bounds are obtained for both exact and inexact attack support estimation. Moreover, a simulation of a water distribution system is presented to validate the proposed techniques.
