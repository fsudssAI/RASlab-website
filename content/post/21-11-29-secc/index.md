Yu Zheng and Sina Ameli are conducting poster presentation on 2021 Southeast Control Conference (SECC).

<!--more-->
The purpose of [SECC](https://secc21.com/) is to provide an inexpensive venue for students and faculty in the Southeast to get together, share ideas, and for students to present research results in dynamical systems and control theory as well as controls-related disciplines. Oral and poster presentations are exclusively given by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers for better training to achieve productive and visible careers in industry, research labs, and academia. SECC comprises twenty-minute talks and a single, one and half-hour long poster presentation session. A banquet, multiple breaks, and a tour of Virginia Tech campus will allow attendees to interact and exchange ideas. <br>

Yu Zheng is conducting a presentation of his work **Resilient Cyber-physcial System design against False Data Injection Attack; Concurrent Learning and Resilient Rstimation**. <br>
Sina Ameli is conducting a presentation of his work **A Distributed Robust Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinearly Coupled Hierarchical Systems with Actuator Faults**.<br>
