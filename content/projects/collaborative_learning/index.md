summary: Nowadays, the huge amount of data are often generated at geographically dispersed edge locations, each capturing only a portion of the global phenomenon of interestCollaborative learning. Collaborative learning is a solution for simultaneously training all models efficiently using all datasets without violating privacy requirements and provide resiliency against bad actors.

## Resilient Collaborative Machine Learning via Network-aware Knowledge Consensus
![concepts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36635562/151391460-fe00b5d0-be13-4452-868e-5ca8623940cd.png)
#### **Novelty** 
- Knowledge similarity measure -
-  New convergence analysis
-  Plug-and-play collaborative learning framework 
- Knowledge support vectors.  <br>
#### **Advantages** 
- Consensus-based learning makes the proposed approach more natural for NTNs, since network communication is adaptive and significantly reduced.
- The plug-and-play framework increase scalability and resiliency to extreme events, including the complete loss of agents.
