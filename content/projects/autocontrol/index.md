summary: We are constucting a cutting-edge self-driving vehicle platform. In this project, several researches are conducted, vison-based lane detection, learning-based object detection, image-based real-world localization, robust motion control and estimation. The self-driving platform is built on a 1/10 vehicle (MicroNole) and a full-size van (AutoNole).

## Overview
The self-driving vehicle platform includes vison-based lane detection, learning-based object detection, image-based real-world localization, robust motion control and estimation. The self-driving platform is built on a 1/10-scale vehicle (MicroNole) and a full-size van (AutoNole).

## Image-based Real-world Localization
Luscio system is a multi-Model learning system for smooth Georeferenced Tracking from an Uncalibrated Monocular Camera.

Progresses:
- Won 2nd place in Navy AI-Track-at-sea competition (aacuracy: 57%). (2020 fall)
- Improved the accuracy of localization to 99.7% for indoor training tasks. (2021 fall)

## Robust Motion Control and Estimation
A vision-based self-driving car platform is being constructed, including model characterization, parameter estimation, sensor fusion, object detection, optimal path planing, robust motion control. <br>
